# Determining the Incumbency Advantage Effects in Canadian Parliament (An Updated Study)

## Abstract
I apply a regression discontinuity approach to determine incumbency advantages in the Canadian Parliament, finding that incumbents enjoy a 10.8â€“13.4% increased probability of winning over non-incumbents. The study distinguishes between breakout years of 1950 and 2011, revealing shifting dynamics in incumbency advantages for the Liberal and Conservative parties.

## 1. Introduction
There have always been debates around whether incumbent candidates have an advantage in getting elected in subsequent elections. This study aims to measure the incumbency effect on the probability of winning and vote share in the Canadian parliament using a regression discontinuity (RD) approach.

## 2. Data
The dataset, sourced from the Library of Parliament of Canada, spans years from 1867 to 2021, covering all 44 parliaments. Variables such as declaredwinner, marginal victory, and MVprev are introduced to identify incumbency and assess the margin of victory.

## 3. Methodology
Using a regression discontinuity model, the study estimates incumbency effects on winning probability. The model incorporates polynomial specifications and bandwidth choices to ensure robustness.

## 4. Results
The main results are based on the overall incumbency effect, showcasing the probability of winning for Liberals and Conservatives pre-1950, post-1950, pre-2011, and post-2011. Two key visualizations are presented:

## 5. Discussion
The discussion interprets the results, emphasizing the stronger incumbency effects for both Liberals and Conservatives before 1950. Additionally, it analyzes the notable increase in Liberal incumbency advantage post-2011, contrasting with the diminished significance for Conservatives.

## 6. Future Studies
The paper suggests future studies could delve into individual parliament analyses, providing a more detailed understanding of how incumbency advantages have evolved over the years.

## 7. References
The study references key works in the field, including Kendall and Rekkas (2012) and Lee (2008), establishing a solid foundation for the research.
